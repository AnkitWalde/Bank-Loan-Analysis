## Problem Statement

### Dashboard 1: Summary

In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

- **Total Loan Applications**: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
  
- **Total Funded Amount**: Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans. Monitor MTD Total Funded Amount and analyze MoM changes.
  
- **Total Amount Received**: Track the total amount received from borrowers for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. Analyze MTD Total Amount Received and observe MoM changes.
  
- **Average Interest Rate**: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations.
  
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers to gauge their financial health. Compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.

#### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIs:

**Good Loan KPIs**:

- **Good Loan Application Percentage**: Calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans' (Fully Paid and Current).
  
- **Good Loan Applications**: Identify the total number of loan applications falling under the 'Good Loan' category.

- **Bad Loan Total Received Amount**: Track the total amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans'.
